<h1>First Let Me Say…</h1>
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve made a post. A lot of changes have been going on with me - we had the holidays, then I moved out of state, and then I started a volunteer data analysis project. The work is confidential, but I hope one day I’ll be able to share what the problem was and my solution.</p>

<h2>Without Further Ado</h2>
<p>I’ve been working on another personal project without a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data">Pitchfork dataset</a> I found on Kaggle. If you know me well, you know that music is my life. I’m a multi-instrumentalist that studied classical-violin, and self-taught myself guitar, bass, and piano. I write and produce my own music. I need to listen to music like someone needs to drink water. To say the least, I was very excited to work with this data.</p>
<p>This post isn’t going to be the project I made working with this data. That will come very soon! I decided though there was a lot of interesting stuff to say with this data alone aside from what’s yet to come. I wanted to give people an opportunity to explore the data and make their own insights in an interactive way. I also wanted to practice a bit more with Tableau. A Tableau story seemed like a great way to do both. Hope you like it! I recommend using it in full screen.</p>
<p>Shoot me an email if you like any of the album recommendations I make, or let me know if you’ve got any recommendations of your own.</p>
