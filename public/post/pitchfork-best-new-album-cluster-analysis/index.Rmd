# Abstract

Music has always been a big part of my life. I'm a classically trained violinist, and a self-taught guitarist, bassist, and pianist. I write and produce my own music and I used to go to near 30 concerts a year. 
~~I'm gonna cry on the dance floor the next time I can even see a concert without worrying about the pandemic. ~~ 

You might have guessed it, I also listen to a lot of music. I used to carry Apple's final iPod iteration, the iPod Classic 160gb, so I could listen to MY music collection at all times. Years into the age of streaming, I was the only one in my friend group still downloading music and putting it on an iPod. I filled ~109gb of the iPod before I decided to give Spotify a shot.
