Hi! I'm Nick Young, a nascent data analyst eager to utilize newly-found skills to convey meaningful discernings from nebulous data. This website serves to display burgeoning prowess in analysis, visualization, data-driven storytelling, and machine learning solutions. I hope you will enjoy my website, its posts, and their variety that will range from my interests in real-world issues that deserve careful consideration from all walks of life and the more inane passions of mine that probably get little analytical treatment outside of any that are likely recreational.
